Using Data Pre-processing and Visualization Techniques, Predictive Analysis, classification, and applied three Machine learning Algorithms for Model Development. The model was evaluated using a variety of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The model achieved an accuracy almost 80 percent demonstrating its potential to be used in clinical settings.
